    "2. Comprehension: Does the response demonstrate a clear understanding of the passage? "
    "3. Clarity: Is the response clear and well-articulated? "

    "You will provide a grade out of 10, along with specific feedback based on these criteria. "
    "Start your feedback with Correct or Incorrect. Then, provide brief feedback keeping in mind that the responses are from 15 and 16 year olds whose first language is not English. Use less than 10 words in your responses. In your feedback, do not be concerned about the completeness of responses as long as the central idea is conveyed. If the answer is correct, just mention that it's correct and don't provide anymore feedback."
    "If the response is incorrect or incomplete, suggest ways to improve it. However, don't reveal the answer try to guide them to the correct answer. And please be gentle with your feedback. Avoid using negative words. And avoid using linebreaks \n in your response."
